    <section class="content">
        <h2>About Black Holes</h2>
        <p>
            Black holes are among the most enigmatic and fascinating objects in the universe. They are regions of
            spacetime where gravity is so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape once it crosses the event
            horizon. Their formation typically follows the dramatic death of a massive star, leaving behind a core of
            incomprehensible density.
        </p>
        <p>
            In astrophysics, black holes challenge our understanding of fundamental physics. Einstein’s theory of
            general relativity predicts that massive objects warp spacetime, and black holes represent the ultimate
            distortion of this fabric. Observations, from X-ray emissions to gravitational lensing, provide compelling
            evidence of their existence.
        </p>
        <p>
            The detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes has opened a new window into the cosmos,
            confirming theoretical predictions and offering insights into the behavior of these extraordinary entities.
            The Event Horizon Telescope’s historic image of a black hole’s shadow further underscores the reality of
            these cosmic phenomena.
        </p>
        <p>
            Black holes come in various sizes. Stellar black holes, formed from individual stars, possess masses several
            times that of our Sun. In contrast, supermassive black holes, located at the centers of galaxies, have
            masses ranging from millions to billions of solar masses. Their gravitational influence shapes the evolution
            of galaxies and the dynamics of the interstellar medium.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the most dramatic effects near a black hole is spaghettification. As objects get closer, the steep
            gravitational gradient stretches and compresses them into long, thin shapes before they are ultimately torn
            apart. This phenomenon illustrates the extreme conditions present near the event horizon.
        </p>
        <p>
            Theoretical models, including Hawking radiation, suggest that black holes may not be entirely eternal but
            could gradually evaporate over time. This idea bridges quantum mechanics and general relativity, inviting
            deeper questions about the nature of information and the ultimate fate of matter consumed by black holes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ongoing research continues to unveil new mysteries about black holes, from the behavior of matter under
            extreme gravity to the potential for new physics beyond our current theories. Each discovery brings us
            closer to understanding not only black holes but also the fundamental workings of the universe.
